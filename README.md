# Image Colorization using CNN

In image colorization, the goal is to produce a colored image given a grayscale input image.
This problem is challenging because it is multimodal -- a single grayscale image may correspond to many plausible colored images.
Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in automatic image colorization (ability to capture semantic information.

I have used images from the Oxford IIIT pet dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanlikesmath/the-oxfordiiit-pet-dataset.
The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset is a 37 category pet dataset with roughly 200 images for each class created by the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford.
The model is trained on images of basset hound which is a subset from the above dataset.
Training images = 134, Validation images = 36, Test images = 30
